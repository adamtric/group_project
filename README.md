Project Roadmap

Topic - How did working the shift to remote work affect publicly traded companies earnings (S&P 500)?

Team Roles - 
Square - Responsible for Repo - Adam
Triangle - Create machine learning mockup - Brian, Melis
Circle - Create mockup of database - Brian, Melis
X - what languages should be used? - Adam, Brian, Melis


Selected Topic - Researching effects of working remotely in publicly traded companies.

Reason topic selected - Reason topic chosen was due to the unprecedented disrupting effect 
of the Covid-19 Pandemic on the global labor market during 2020.
Short term consequences included millions of people losing jobs while others had to adjust rapidly
to working from home. Other workers were deemed essential and continued to work in hospitals,
grocery stores, sanitation, and warehouse workers all while under new protocols to reduce the
spread of the virus. This topic was selected to specifically understand how companies were 
affected by the paradigm shift of having a large portion of the workforce suddenly start 
working from home.

Description of the Source of Data - We are pulling quarterly earnings from Yahoo Finance starting 
with the first quarter of 2018 through final quarter of 2021 so that we have two years
of precovid data to compare to postcovid data (2020-2021). BLS is also a great secondary source
to help explore productivity and cost statistics during the Pandemic.

Questions hope to answer with the data? - 
- Did remote work affect company earnings during covid vs precovid earnings?
- Does working remotely save companies money and did it affect quarterly earnings?
- Did remote work increase hours logged in to work and thus affect earnings?
- Need more solid questions...


Machine Learning - 
Present provisional machine learning model that accomplishes the following:
- Takes in data from provisional database
- Outputs label for input data

Dashboard Integration - 
Present provisional database model that accomplishes the following:
- Sample data that mimics expected final database structure or schema?
- Draft machine learning model is connected to the provisional database
